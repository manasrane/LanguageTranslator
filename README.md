Here’s a clean, professional, and beginner-friendly README template you can use for your **Seq2Seq Transformer Language Translator** project on GitHub:

# 🌐 Language Translator — Seq2Seq Transformer (PyTorch)

A language translation model built from scratch using a custom implementation of the Transformer architecture in PyTorch. This project demonstrates how sequence-to-sequence learning works for neural machine translation (NMT), without using high-level frameworks like Hugging Face.

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/language-translator-transformer.git
cd language-translator-transformer
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv mlenv
source mlenv/bin/activate  # or mlenv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Training

```bash
python train.py
```

> 💡 By default, the model runs on CPU. GPU support (NVIDIA) can be added with `torch.cuda`.
